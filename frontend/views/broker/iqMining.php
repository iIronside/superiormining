    Introducing IQMining, the cloud mining company that offers a really great selection of reliable
    and profitable cloud mining contracts. The website looks like an excellent choice for high-skilled
    investors and individuals with no previous experience in digital currency. We also liked IQMining
    for quick and high-qualified customer support that usually responds to the requests in literally
    5-10 minutes. Flexible pricing and fixed payments are other benefits of IQMining that we loved
    (so maybe you do). The company works with different currencies and involves over a hundred
    new customers every day, according to their website information.

        How We Tested IQMining
    </h3>
    <p class="brokerPage__aboutText">
        IQMining is a global cloud mining project created in late 2016. As a professional mining
        company, they own some big industrial data centers located in Canada, Iceland, China,
        Georgia, and other countries which are traditionally considered to be the best for installation of
        mining facilities. The head-quarter and a main customer support center are located in the United
        Kingdom. We also have noticed the company actively provides a lot of promos and specials to
        involve new customers.
        Let's take a quick look at how to get the ball rolling on IQMining. The easy and convenient
        registration and purchasing are the first things we really appreciated on the website. To open an
        account, a new user has to fill out a registration form by entering some personal details (such as
        first and second name, real phone number, email address, and password). Do not forget it is
        always better to read the Terms and Conditions section before signing up. The next step is
        purchasing a contract, and right after it is done, you can start cloud mining. So as you can see,
        it's easy to start, and nothing special to talk about here.IQMining offers not only regular but as well
        'Pro' contracts with an extra 20% interest per year.
        The cost and profitability of a cloud mining contract depend on the power you rent (the hash rate
        that is measured in GH/s). All offers include stable daily payouts in the currency of the contract.
        Users purchase one-year, two-years, five-years, and even a lifetime contract on the IQMining
        platform. We personally found the diversity of options on their website as great. The profitability
        rates start at 125% per contract period. Also, you can use a mining calculator on the site to
        estimate your potential profit. The company provides a referral program.
    </p>
    <p class="brokerPage__aboutText">
        Customers who rented a hash power from IQMining get mined funds to their accounts
        im/mediately. You will find different payment methods for deposits and payouts on the website,
        including Visa and Mastercard, several digital currencies, and bank transfers. All withdrawal
        methods are done without any commission. And surely, you can re-purchase your contract and
        continue making digital money from cloud mining.
