                We Tried HashShiny Before We Write About Them
            </h3>
            <p class="brokerPage__aboutText">
                HashShiny is a top cloud mining company from Hong Kong that was founded in 2017 by a
                squad of young tech and dotcom startup experts. At the current moment, they offer almost 1.5%
                of the global digital currency hash rate (and it sounds really good, in fact). The company
                introduces new products and services regularly, and it is just one reason why we love
                HashShiny. The other thing is the fact they strongly care about the environment by using mainly
                wind and hydropower energy sources in their data centers. State-of-the-art mining hardware is
                installed in Myanmar and Kazakhstan. HashShiny data centers contain over 15 thousand ASICs
                and GPU rigs.
                Our cloud mining experience with HashShiny was nothing but excellent. It is really easy to open
                an account, get verified, and start earning digital currency on their website. The registration process is typical. You have to fill out a form, confirm your email address, and verify your identity
                to start making money. Users also can sign up with popular social media, such as Google and
                Facebook. Note earning process starts automatically within just an hour after you purchase the
                cloud mining contract and get rented hash power.
                When choosing a contract, pay attention to profitability, hash rate, and prices per GH/s. For
                users' convenience, HashShiny supports some different payment and payout methods.
                Purchase selected cloud mining contracts using any regular credit card, PayPal, UnionPay,
                digital currencies, or other options (200+ payment methods are available so far). The company
                supports almost all kinds of digital money wallets. Daily revenues from cloud mining contracts
                enroll straight to the Mining Balance on the relevant section on the HashShiny website.
            </p>
            <p class="brokerPage__aboutText">
                Payouts occur once per day every day. The first payout is usually done the next day after the
                customer purchases a contract. Any user can create a withdrawal request once per 24 hours.
                Note that the company accepts refunds for users. We also loved the automated Reinvestment
                tool to get more hash rate and higher profit from cloud mining.
