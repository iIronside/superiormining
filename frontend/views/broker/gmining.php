                This Is Why We Like Gmining
            </h3>
            <p class="brokerPage__aboutText">
                GMining is a licensed company that offers customers several cloud mining contracts.
                Data centers with mining equipment are located in different countries across the globe, such as Iceland, Georgia, and Kazakhstan. The Gmining team cares about climate change issues, so
                they do their best to protect the environment by using mainly green technologies in their data
                centers. By the way, about 70% of used energy comes from solar panels and wind generators.
                We found Gmining a reliable cloud mining site affordable not for advanced investors only but
                also for 100% dummies (the signing up process is child's play, in fact). The starting amount to
                rent hash power on the platform is $500 only, so any individual with a small amount can join
                them with zero issues. You need to fill out a registration form to sign up on Gmining. All personal
                information you enter on the website is protected by the latest encryption technologies. The
                payment information is also safe and secure on the Gmining website (at the very least, they
                claim it). If you face any difficulty during the registration or verification, feel free to reach support.
                It looks to us like the platform has a really good customer support team with a short time of
                response.
                At the moment, there are several types of cloud mining contracts available on the website.
                Gmining offers customers to rent remote digital currency miners under one-year contracts.
                Investors can purchase them from any place by using different payment methods. Both credit
                cards and digital money wallets are accepted. Bank transfers are also available. What about
                offered contracts? We actually found some attractive options with pretty high hash rates and
                affordable pricing as well. The other advantage of the website is zero setup fees for customers.
            </p>
            <p class="brokerPage__aboutText">
                Users get their income from cloud mining daily. Any customer can withdraw profit at any minute
                or reinvest funds into the new cloud mining contracts to earn more digital money on the Gmining
                website. The company provides really quick payouts available 24/7.
