                    What We Think About ECOS
                </h3>
                <p class="brokerPage__aboutText">
                    Let’s start with quick facts about the company. The ECOS project was launched in 2017 in the
                    free economic zone of Armenia. The head office is located in Hrazdan city. Since then, the
                    company has received numerous awards and certificates, including Slashdot and SourceForge.
                    The residence of a free-economic zone allows the ECOS platform to offer customers very
                    affordable rates (because of special tax conditions). The services are available via web version
                    for PC and mobile app as well. Any registered user also can join a referral program to increase
                    earnings from cloud mining on ECOS.
                    Ok, now let’s see how to use the ECOS DeFi platform if you are totally new to cloud mining
                    technologies. First of all, a new user should sign up and open an account. To register, you have
                    to enter and confirm a valid email (the confirmation code will be sent to your address). In the
                    next step, enter your country and telephone number. Note users are required to confirm their
                    telephone numbers during the registration. For the record, the signing-up procedure is currently
                    available not only on the website but also via a mobile app on the ECOS DeFi platform.
                    You can easily find a variety of offers in the Cloud Mining section on the ECOS website. The
                    company offers easy access to real mining power without installing any hardware under different
                    kinds of contracts. It is very easy to use an online cloud mining calculator to calculate the total
                    hash power, income amount, and profitability of each tariff plan. All you have to do to purchase a
                    contract is just make a deposit via credit card, bank invoice, or digital currencies. Users can
                    send ECOS cloud mining contracts as gifts for their friends, and it is another helpful option on
                    the website.
                </p>
                <p class="brokerPage__aboutText">
                    As a trustworthy cloud mining company, ECOS promises customers daily payouts and quick
                    withdrawals. And they really pay fast as we have seen personally. The company provides
                    different popular methods for payouts. And it usually takes a few hours to receive mined funds
                    on their website.
